# Spring Boot Backend with Angular Frontend and MariaDB Database

## Unfortunately due to limited time and coming back from vacation only this Monday i didnt get to fully complete to perfection all the tasks on this project.

 Here are some things i wanted to do: 

 1 -> Implementing security for all exposed endpoints. I did limit some http methods on some endpoints but not all of them. 
 2 -> I used pagination on task 1 but not in table 2 for the sake of saving time but i could have reused the pagination component i created.
 3 -> Using a loader when the user clicks on a list item and also fix the ordered list moving when pagination happens.
 4 -> Lastly though i initialized the project with spring.io and explicitely chose java8 the project is configured to use java17 which i didnt noticed early.
 5 -> Time to refactor and maybe find better ways to implement services.
